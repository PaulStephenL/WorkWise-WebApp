/*
  # WorkWise Database Schema

  1. Tables
    - companies: Store company information
    - company_admins: Link companies with admin users
    - jobs: Store job listings
    - applications: Track job applications
    - users: Link with auth.users and store additional user data

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for public access, authenticated users, and admins

  3. Note: Users must be created through Supabase Auth first
    - The users table will be populated when users sign up through the auth system
